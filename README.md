TDH-HADOOP
===========

  TDH is a custom hadoop distribution with an initial configuration as a
pseudo-distributed cluster with 1 worker node. The distribution is based
entirely on direct apache versions. This project provides a set of scripts
for managing the environment.


### Configuring the Hadoop Distribution

  The ecosystem can be built using binary packages from the various
Apache projects or built from source. The supporting scripts and
instructions are based on building a distribution using the following
versions:

- Hadoop 2.7.x
- HBase  1.1.x - 1.2
- Hive   1.2.x
- Spark  1.6.x - 2.3.x
- Kafka  0.10.x

Refer to the setup document in *docs/tdh-hadoop-setup.md* for building 
up a TDH distribution from scratch.
